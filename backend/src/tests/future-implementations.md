# Future Test Implementations

This document outlines the remaining test implementations that would need to be created to achieve full test coverage for the OKGYM backend, focusing specifically on the Exercise module.

## Unit Tests

### Exercise Service

We've implemented tests for:
- CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete exercises)
- Category management
- Equipment management
- Media management
- Exercise relationship management
- Search and filtering

Remaining tests to implement:
- Validation logic tests
- Error handling edge cases
- Cache invalidation tests
- Pagination tests

### Repository Tests

Create unit tests for custom repository methods:
- Custom query builders
- Specialized search methods
- Transaction handling

## Integration Tests

### API Endpoint Tests

We've created integration tests for the main exercise API endpoints. Additional tests needed:

- Complete CRUD endpoints
  - Update tests for proper validation
  - Additional authentication/authorization tests
  
- Category Endpoints
  - Category creation with validation
  - Category updates and deletions
  - Category hierarchies (if applicable)
  
- Equipment Endpoints
  - Equipment CRUD operations
  - Equipment filtering and searching
  
- Relationship Endpoints
  - Creating exercise relationships
  - Retrieving related exercises
  - Validating relationship types
  
- Search Endpoints
  - Advanced search capabilities
  - Filtering by multiple criteria
  - Sorting and pagination

### Service-to-Repository Integration

Tests for how services interact with repositories:
- Transaction handling across multiple repositories
- Batch operations
- Query optimization

## Performance Tests

Current performance tests cover:
- Caching mechanisms
- Basic search performance
- Memory usage

Additional performance tests needed:
- Load testing with simulated concurrent users
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategy comparisons
- Cold start vs. warm cache timings
- Connection pool behavior
- Resource utilization under heavy load

## E2E Tests

End-to-end tests covering complete user flows:
- User registration to workout completion
- Exercise program creation to execution
- Admin flows for managing content

## Type-Related Improvements

During test implementation, we identified several type-related improvements:
1. Better alignment between test mocks and actual entity types
2. Consistent use of DTOs across services and controllers
3. More specific error types
4. Improved interface definitions for service methods

## CI Integration

Future work on CI integration:
1. Automated test runs on pull requests
2. Performance regression detection
3. Code coverage requirements
4. Linting and TypeScript type checking

## Testing Tools to Add

1. **Supertest**: For proper HTTP testing
2. **Faker.js**: For generating test data
3. **Testcontainers**: For isolated DB testing
4. **k6**: For load testing
5. **NYC (Istanbul)**: For code coverage
6. **Wallaby.js**: For continuous testing during development
