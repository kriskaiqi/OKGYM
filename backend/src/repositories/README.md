# TypeORM Type Fixes for Repository Layer

## Overview of Issues

The TypeScript errors in the repository layer are primarily related to TypeORM's type system not properly matching with our application's data model. The most common issues include:

1. **Query.where property type incompatibility** - When we try to add properties to the `where` clause of a query, TypeScript complains that these properties don't exist in the `FindOptionsWhere<Entity>` type.

2. **Raw Query typing issues** - The `Raw()` function from TypeORM doesn't properly propagate type information, causing TypeScript to report errors.

3. **Order property type issues** - Similar to the `where` property, the `order` property has type incompatibilities.

## Solution Approach

We've addressed these issues using type assertions (`as any` or as specific types) in strategic places. While this isn't the ideal solution from a type safety perspective, it's a pragmatic approach given TypeORM's type limitations.

### Example Fixes:

```typescript
// Before
const query: FindManyOptions<Entity> = {
  where: {},  // Type error here
  relations: [...],
  take: limit,
  order: {}   // Type error here
};

query.where = { ...query.where, propertyName: value }; // Error: Property 'propertyName' does not exist on type 'FindOptionsWhere<Entity>'

// After
const query: FindManyOptions<Entity> = {
  where: {} as any,  // Using type assertion
  relations: [...],
  take: limit,
  order: {} as any   // Using type assertion
};

(query.where as any) = { ...(query.where as any), propertyName: value }; // No type error with assertion
```

### Patterns to Follow

When fixing type errors in repositories:

1. Add `as any` type assertions to the initial `query.where` and `query.order` declarations
2. When modifying `query.where`, cast both sides using `(query.where as any) = { ...(query.where as any), ... }`
3. For Raw queries, add `as any` to the Raw query result
4. In `findOne`, `findOneBy`, etc. methods, add type assertions to the `where` clause

## Long-term Solutions

For a more type-safe approach in the future, consider:

1. Creating custom TypeORM repository classes with more accurate type definitions
2. Implementing a repository abstraction layer that encapsulates TypeORM's quirks
3. Exploring alternative ORMs with better TypeScript support
4. Contributing type improvements to TypeORM itself

## Performance Considerations

The type assertions have no runtime impact - they're purely for TypeScript type checking during development.
