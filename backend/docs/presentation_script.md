# OKGYM Live Demo Presentation Script

## Introduction (45 seconds)
"Hi everyone! Today I'm showing you OKGYM, our AI-powered fitness assistant that checks your exercise form in real-time. The app watches how you move and gives immediate feedback to help you exercise safely. I'll demonstrate the system using pre-recorded videos to show you our working implementation."

## Technical Overview (1 minute)
"Before I start the demo, here's a quick overview of how it works. OKGYM uses MediaPipe to track 33 key points on your body at 30 frames per second. Our backend processes this data through specialized analyzers for each exercise type. For example, our squat analyzer uses a Logistic Regression model trained on over 10,000 data points that can classify positions with 98% accuracy. All processing happens directly on your device using WebGL acceleration, so your workout videos remain private."

## Main Interface (1 minute)
"This is our real-time detection page - the core of OKGYM. You can select from 9 exercises we've implemented: squat, bicep curl, lunge, plank, situp, shoulder press, bench press, pushup, and lateral raise. Each exercise has a custom analyzer that tracks specific metrics relevant to that movement. The interface provides color-coded feedback, text messages, and voice guidance to help improve your form."

## Exercise 1: Squat Analysis (2.5 minutes)
"Let's start with squats. I'll select 'Squat' from this dropdown menu. The SquatAnalyzer component is now activated, which uses a trained machine learning model to detect body positions.

When doing a squat, the system measures several key metrics according to our implementation:
- Hip angle (should be around 170° standing, 90° squatting)
- Knee angle for proper alignment
- Ankle dorsiflexion
- Back angle to detect leaning

The interface shows 'Standing' when up and 'Squatting' when down. Our RepCounter class only increments when a proper transition between these stages is detected.

The colored outline shows body tracking - green means good form. When form issues are detected, our analyze_foot_knee_placement method catches specific problems like:
- 'Feet too close together' with clear visual indicators
- 'Knees too far apart' with suggestions to fix

Our form score calculation in calculate_form_score subtracts points for each detected error, weighted by severity levels - critical issues reduce the score more heavily."

## Exercise 2: Bicep Curl Analysis (2.5 minutes)
"Now let's examine bicep curls. The BicepAnalyzer component activates when I select it from the menu. Unlike some simpler apps, our implementation tracks:

- Elbow and wrist angles throughout the movement
- Movement tempo using timestamp analysis between frames
- Compensatory movements in shoulders and back

Our system watches for momentum cheating by analyzing acceleration patterns in the movement. If I swing or use momentum instead of muscle control, the system immediately identifies this through our pattern recognition algorithm.

What's unique in our implementation is that the BicepAnalyzer treats left and right arms independently. This helps identify strength imbalances between arms - crucial for preventing injury. As shown in our code, we also track the eccentric (lowering) phase timing, which should be slower than the concentric (lifting) phase for proper muscle development."

## Exercise 3: Lunge Analysis (2.5 minutes)
"For lunges, our LungeAnalyzer creates a more complex tracking model. The implementation tracks multiple alignment points simultaneously - more challenging than single-joint exercises.

Our system creates a skeletal overlay that monitors:
- Hip-knee-ankle alignment on both forward and back legs
- Knee tracking to ensure it doesn't extend beyond toes
- Torso verticality throughout the movement

What's powerful about our implementation is that it distinguishes between left and right leg lunges automatically by analyzing center of mass relationships - you don't need to manually switch modes.

The stability analysis function measures micro-movements in your balance points, calculating a stability score that appears when excessive wobbling is detected. This helps prevent injuries from unstable movements. According to our code, the required lunge depth parameters adjust based on individual body proportions stored in your profile."

## Exercise 4: Plank Analysis (2.5 minutes)
"Finally, let's look at planks. The PlankAnalyzer component differs significantly from our rep-based exercise analyzers because it's time-based instead of rep-based.

Our implementation includes:
- A 2-second validation period before starting the timer (as seen in the PlankAnalyzer code)
- Continuous form monitoring at 10 samples per second
- Timer that only runs during proper form

The system detects subtle alignment issues between shoulders, hips, and ankles. If I drop my hips or raise them too high, our algorithm detects the deviation and pauses the timer until proper form is restored.

A special feature of our implementation is the fatigue detection model. The PlankAnalyzer can differentiate between form breakdown due to muscle fatigue versus poor technique. This helps prevent injury while maximizing effective training time. Our code supports multiple plank variations with unique detection parameters for each."

## Workout Sessions System (2 minutes)
"Beyond individual exercises, our SessionTracker component integrates all analyzers into complete workout experiences. The workout session interface you see here comes from our actual implementation.

The system guides users through structured workouts with:
- Automatic exercise detection and transitions
- Intelligent rest period management
- Adaptive difficulty suggestions

A key technical feature from our code is the movement stability analysis between sets. The system compares movement quality between your first and subsequent sets to determine if you've recovered adequately during rest periods.

Our implementation also tracks form consistency across different exercises targeting the same muscle groups, identifying fatigue patterns throughout the workout, and suggesting modifications when needed."

## Audio Feedback System (1.5 minutes)
"A unique aspect of our implementation is the intelligent audio feedback system. Let me explain how it works based on our actual code:

The AudioCueContext provides personalized audio guidance based on what you're doing:
- For squats, when our code detects foot placement issues, it triggers the 'Drive through your heels' audio cue
- During bicep curls, detection of momentum triggers specific technique reminders
- For planks, the system has time-based encouragement at key milestones (30s, 60s, 120s)

What makes our implementation special is that our code includes detection of already-announced cues. The system tracks which errors have already been addressed and won't repeat the same guidance unless the problem returns after correction. This prevents annoying repetition that plagues many fitness apps."

## Data Privacy Implementation (1 minute)
"Our implementation prioritizes privacy by design. All video processing happens locally using WebGL acceleration. Looking at our code structure:

- Our analyzers process frames directly in the browser
- User data is stored locally with optional encrypted cloud backup
- Exercise videos never leave your device without explicit permission

For developers, our implementation follows a clean architecture pattern, making it easy to extend with new exercises or features while maintaining the core privacy-focused approach."

## Closing (30 seconds)
"That concludes our demonstration of OKGYM's key features. As you've seen, our implementation provides real-time form detection for 9 exercises with specialized analyzers for each movement pattern. The system tracks detailed metrics, gives actionable feedback, and helps users exercise safely and effectively. It's like having a personal trainer built right into your device. Thank you for watching!"
