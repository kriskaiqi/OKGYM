### Edge Cases
- Testing with users who have gaps in workout history
- Testing with extremely frequent workout data (multiple same-day sessions)
- Dashboard behavior when a metric has no associated data
- Results: Edge cases handled with appropriate data visualization adaptations

### Error Handling
- Graceful display when API fails to fetch progress data
- Informative messages when specific metrics cannot be calculated
- Visual indicators for data that may be inaccurate due to insufficient samples
- Recovery options when charts fail to render

### Performance Testing
- Dashboard initial load under 3 seconds with typical dataset
- Chart interactions (zoom, pan, filter) respond within 200ms
- Memory usage remains stable during extended dashboard viewing
- Data refresh completes within 1 second

### Integration Points
- Integrates with workout history database
- Connects to achievement tracking system
- Links with goal tracking component
- Feeds data to progress reports generator

### Dependencies
- Chart visualization library
- Data aggregation service
- User workout history API
- Progress calculation algorithms

### Test Environment
