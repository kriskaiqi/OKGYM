- Creating overlapping goals for the same metric
- Results: Edge cases handled with appropriate validation and user feedback

### Error Handling
- Validation errors displayed with clear correction guidance
- Server errors during goal creation/update handled gracefully
- Recovery options when goal progress calculation fails
- Data integrity checks for inconsistent goal data

### Performance Testing
