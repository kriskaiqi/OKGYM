### Edge Cases
- Handling extremely frequent weight entries (multiple per day)
- Significant weight fluctuations over short periods
- Very long tracking history (years of data)
- Results: Edge cases handled with appropriate data handling and visualization

### Error Handling
- Input validation with clear error messages
- Confirmation for suspicious data entry
- Network error handling during save operations
- Data recovery options for accidentally deleted entries
- Graceful handling of server unavailability

### Performance Testing
- Entry addition completes within 500ms
- Chart rendering with 100+ entries within 1 second
- Data export with 500+ entries within 3 seconds
- Smooth scrolling through historical data without lag

### Integration Points
- Integrates with user profile module
- Connects to fitness goals component
- Links with progress dashboard charts
- Feeds data to progress reports generator
- Connects to measurement units preferences

### Dependencies
- Weight data storage service
- Chart visualization library
- Data export utilities
- Validation services
- Unit conversion utilities

### Test Environment
