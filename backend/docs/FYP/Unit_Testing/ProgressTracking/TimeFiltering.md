### Edge Cases
- Handling leap years in date calculations
- Filtering periods with daylight saving time changes
- Extremely narrow date ranges (single day)
- Results: Edge cases handled with proper date calculations and appropriate UI feedback

### Error Handling
- Invalid date range selection validation
- Graceful handling of future dates in range
- Clear error messages for impossible date combinations
- Recovery options when filter application fails

### Performance Testing
- Filter application completes within 300ms
- Chart redrawing after filter change within 500ms
- Memory usage stable during repeated filter changes
- Smooth transition animations during filter changes

### Integration Points
- Integrates with progress dashboard
- Connects to workout history database
- Links with chart visualization components
- Feeds filtered data to progress reports
- Synchronizes with user preferences

### Dependencies
- Date/time manipulation library
- Data filtering service
- User preferences API
- Chart redrawing utilities
- Browser storage for preference persistence

### Test Environment
- Node.js v14+
- Jest 29+ with time mocking utilities
- Mock data with various time distributions
- Various timezones for date handling tests
- Multiple browser environments

### Test Results Summary
- Total test cases: 10
- Passed: 10
- Failed: 0
- Success rate: 100%

### Recommendations
- Add tests for relative time filters (e.g., "Last 90 days")
- Implement tests for calendar-based filtering (month/year views)
- Develop tests for comparison between non-consecutive time periods
