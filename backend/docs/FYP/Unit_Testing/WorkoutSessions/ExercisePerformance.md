## Component: Exercise Performance

### Overview
This component allows users to record their performance for each exercise during a workout session, with automatic recording when real-time detection is enabled. It handles tracking repetitions, sets, and providing rest timer functionality.

### Test Cases
## 5.2.3.2 Exercise Performance

### Edge Cases
- Recording extremely high rep counts
- Recording with unstable network connection
- Results: All edge cases handled as expected, no data loss

### Error Handling
- Handles server errors and data validation failures with clear messages
- Provides offline capability to prevent data loss

### Performance Testing
- Performance recording completes within 1 second
- Rest timer accuracy within 50ms

### Integration Points
- Integrates with session management and data storage
- Integrates with real-time detection module if enabled
- Integration tests passed for both components

### Dependencies
- Session management
- Real-time detection module (optional)
- Timer service
- Mock data for error scenarios

### Test Environment
- Node.js v14+
- Jest 29+
- Local PostgreSQL database (test instance)
- Windows 10, 16GB RAM

### Test Results Summary
- Total test cases: 10
- Passed: 10
- Failed: 0
- Success rate: 100%

### Recommendations
- Add tests for concurrent edits from multiple devices
- Add tests for extended workout sessions (2+ hours)
