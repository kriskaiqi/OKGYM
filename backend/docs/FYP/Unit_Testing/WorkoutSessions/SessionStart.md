### Edge Cases
- Starting multiple sessions simultaneously
- Starting session with extremely large workout plan
- Results: All edge cases handled as expected, no crashes

### Error Handling
- Handles server errors and session creation failures with clear messages
- Handles previous incomplete sessions with user choice

### Performance Testing
- Session starts within 2 seconds under normal load
- Exercise instruction loads within 1 second

### Integration Points
- Integrates with workout database and session management
- Integrates with real-time detection module if supported
- Integration tests passed for both components

### Dependencies
- Workout database
- Session management
- Real-time detection module (optional)
- Mock data for error scenarios

### Test Environment
- Node.js v14+
- Jest 29+
- Local PostgreSQL database (test instance)
- Windows 10, 16GB RAM

### Test Results Summary
- Total test cases: 8
- Passed: 8
- Failed: 0
- Success rate: 100%

### Recommendations
- Add tests for network disconnection during session start
- Add tests for device compatibility with real-time detection
