## Component: Form Monitoring

### Overview
This component monitors a user's exercise form in real-time, providing feedback on posture, movement accuracy, and suggesting corrections when necessary. It helps users perform exercises safely and effectively.

### Test Cases
## 5.2.5.3 Form Monitoring

| ID  | Test Procedure                                      | Test Data                        | Expected Result                                      | Actual Result | Status |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| 23.1 | Initialize form monitoring with valid exercise      | Push-up exercise selection       | Form monitoring starts with correct reference points | As Expected   | Pass               |
| 23.2 | Detect correct exercise form                        | Video of perfect push-up form    | "Good form" feedback displayed                       | As Expected   | Pass               |
| 23.3 | Detect minor form issues                            | Video with slight elbow flare    | "Adjust elbow position" feedback displayed           | As Expected   | Pass               |
| 23.4 | Detect major form issues                            | Video with back arching          | "Warning: Correct back position" displayed           | As Expected   | Pass               |
| 23.5 | Real-time angle calculation                         | Live camera feed with movement   | Joint angles calculated within 50ms                  | As Expected   | Pass               |
| 23.6 | Posture correction suggestions                      | Incorrect squat depth            | Specific correction instruction displayed            | As Expected   | Pass               |
| 23.7 | Rep counting with correct form                      | Video with 10 correct push-ups   | 10 reps counted and displayed                        | As Expected   | Pass               |
| 23.8 | Rep rejection with incorrect form                   | Video with 5 incorrect push-ups  | 0 valid reps counted                                 | As Expected   | Pass               |
| 23.9 | Form analysis with different body types             | Videos from 5 different users    | Accurate form detection for all body types           | As Expected   | Pass               |
| 23.10| Form feedback visibility and clarity                | Various form issues              | Clear, actionable feedback provided                  | As Expected   | Pass               |

### Edge Cases
- Detection with partial body visibility (user partially out of frame)
- Form monitoring under low light conditions
- Detection of uncommon exercise variations
- Results: Edge cases handled with appropriate user feedback

### Error Handling
- Handles camera interruptions with recovery
- Provides feedback when user is not in proper starting position
- Alerts when body detection confidence is low
- Handles model prediction errors gracefully

### Performance Testing
- Form analysis processing under 100ms per frame
- Stable feedback without flickering
- Consistent performance across 5-minute continuous sessions

### Integration Points
- Integrates with pose estimation model
- Connects to exercise reference database
- Links with metrics calculation component
- Feeds data to exercise history logging

### Dependencies
- TensorFlow.js pose detection model
- Exercise form reference dataset
- Real-time feedback rendering component
- Camera input processing module

### Test Environment
- Node.js v14+
- Jest 29+ with canvas mock
- Chrome browser with WebGL support
- Standard 1080p webcam
- Test performed on quad-core CPU with 16GB RAM

### Test Results Summary
- Total test cases: 10
- Passed: 10
- Failed: 0
- Success rate: 100%

### Recommendations
- Add tests for different lighting conditions
- Implement tests for multiple users in frame
- Develop tests for specialized mobility-limited form variants

### Appendix
- Reference angles for each tested exercise
- Form deviation thresholds
