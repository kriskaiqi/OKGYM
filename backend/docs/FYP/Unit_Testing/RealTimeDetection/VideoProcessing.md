### Edge Cases
- Processing extremely short videos (< 3 seconds)
- Handling corrupted video files
- Videos with no detectable human movement
- Results: Edge cases handled with appropriate error messages and guidance for users

### Error Handling
- Displays clear error messages for file size limits
- Handles unsupported format errors with format suggestions
- Manages processing failures with retry options
- Provides recovery options for interrupted uploads

### Performance Testing
- Upload speed optimized for 10MB+ files
- Processing time under 2x video duration
- Memory usage remains under 500MB during processing
- Parallel uploads limited to prevent resource exhaustion

### Integration Points
- Integrates with file upload component
- Connects to video transcoding service
- Links with form analysis AI model
- Feeds processed video to detection component

### Dependencies
- Video encoding/decoding library
- File upload component
- Video storage service
- Progress tracking service

### Test Environment
- Node.js v14+
- Jest 29+
