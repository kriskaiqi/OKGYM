## Component: Metrics Display

### Overview
This component handles the real-time display of exercise metrics, statistics, and form feedback during detection sessions. It supports different layout options (landscape and vertical) to optimize viewing on various devices.

### Test Cases
## 5.2.5.4 Metrics Display

### Edge Cases
- Display behavior when metrics exceed expected ranges
- Performance with extremely rapid metric changes
- Behavior when switching between exercises mid-session
- Results: Edge cases handled with graceful display adjustments

### Error Handling
- Handles missing metric data with appropriate placeholders
- Manages display during connection interruptions
- Recovers layout after browser resize events
- Provides fallback if layout preference cannot be saved

### Performance Testing
- Metrics update within 50ms of data changes
- Layout toggle completes within 200ms
- Memory usage remains stable during extended sessions
- 60fps maintained during continuous updates

### Integration Points
- Integrates with real-time detection data stream
- Connects to user preference service
- Links with exercise database for form references
- Connects to browser storage for preference persistence

### Dependencies
- React state management
- Responsive design framework
- Local storage API
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates

### Test Environment
- Node.js v14+
- Jest 29+ with React Testing Library
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari browsers
- Desktop and mobile viewports
- Touch and non-touch interfaces

### Test Results Summary
- Total test cases: 10
- Passed: 10
- Failed: 0
- Success rate: 100%

### Recommendations
