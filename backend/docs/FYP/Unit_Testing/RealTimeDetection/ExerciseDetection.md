# Unit Testing Documentation

## Component: Exercise Detection

### Overview
This component allows users to start a real-time exercise detection session using their device camera to monitor form and count repetitions. It handles camera permissions, user positioning, and session initialization.

### Test Cases
## 5.2.5.1 Exercise Detection

### Edge Cases
- Testing with extremely bright or dark lighting conditions
- Testing with multiple people in camera frame
- Results: Edge cases handled with appropriate user feedback, no crashes

### Error Handling
- Handles camera permission issues with clear instructions
- Handles positioning errors with visual guidance
- Handles system errors with retry options

### Performance Testing
- Detection initialization completes within 3 seconds on standard hardware
- Skeletal tracking maintains 24+ fps on recommended hardware
- Memory usage stays below 300MB during extended sessions

### Integration Points
- Integrates with device camera API
- Integrates with AI detection model
- Integrates with exercise database
- Integration tests passed for all components

### Dependencies
- Camera access API
- AI detection model
- Exercise database
- Mock data for error scenarios

### Test Environment
