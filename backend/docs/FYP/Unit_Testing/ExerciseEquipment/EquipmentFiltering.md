## Component: Equipment Filtering

### Overview
This component allows users to filter the equipment database based on various criteria such as equipment type, target muscle groups, difficulty level, space requirements, and specialized features. It handles UI updates and error scenarios for filtering actions.

### Test Cases
## 5.2.4.6 Equipment Filtering

### Edge Cases
- Filtering with many concurrent filters
- Filtering with specialized equipment categories
- Results: All edge cases handled as expected, no UI lag or crash

### Error Handling
- Handles server errors and invalid input with clear messages
- Maintains previous state on error

### Performance Testing
- Filter results update within 1 second under normal load
- Multiple filter combinations respond within 2 seconds

### Integration Points
- Integrates with equipment database
- Integrates with filtering and search functionality
- Integration tests passed for all filter criteria

### Dependencies
- Equipment database
- Filtering and search service
- Mock data for error scenarios

### Test Environment
- Node.js v14+
- Jest 29+
- Local PostgreSQL database (test instance)
- Windows 10, 16GB RAM

### Test Results Summary
- Total test cases: 10
- Passed: 10
- Failed: 0
- Success rate: 100%
