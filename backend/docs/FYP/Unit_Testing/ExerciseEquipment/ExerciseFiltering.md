### Edge Cases
- Filtering with many concurrent filters
- Filtering with special characters in search terms
- Results: All edge cases handled as expected, no UI lag or crash

### Error Handling
- Handles server errors and invalid input with clear messages
- Maintains previous state on error

### Performance Testing
- Filter results update within 1 second under normal load
- Multiple filter combinations respond within 2 seconds

### Integration Points
- Integrates with exercise database
- Integrates with filtering and search functionality
- Integration tests passed for all filter criteria

### Dependencies
- Exercise database
- Filtering and search service
- Mock data for error scenarios

### Test Environment
- Node.js v14+
