#### Tester feedbacks and suggestions:
As a personal trainer, I have mixed feelings about the OKGYM platform. The exercise detection and form monitoring features are absolutely outstanding - they're accurate, responsive, and provide excellent feedback that rivals in-person training. The exercise library and equipment guides are also top-notch.

Strengths:
- Exceptional exercise detection accuracy
- Excellent form monitoring and feedback
- Comprehensive exercise library
- Detailed equipment guides
- Fast loading times for videos

Major Concerns:
- The workout management system is severely limited:
  * Cannot create complex supersets or circuit training
  * Difficult to modify workout plans on the fly
  * Limited options for rest periods and exercise timing
  * No way to create template workouts for reuse
- Progress tracking and goal setting need significant improvement:
  * Cannot track multiple clients' progress effectively
  * Limited customization for different training styles
  * Workout history visualization is basic and lacks detail

The platform has incredible potential with its AI capabilities, but the workout management limitations make it challenging to use for serious training programs. I would strongly recommend improving the workout planning flexibility and adding more advanced features for tracking progress and creating customized training programs.
