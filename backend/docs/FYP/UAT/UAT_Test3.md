#### Tester feedbacks and suggestions:
As a data analyst and fitness enthusiast, I find the OKGYM platform lacks essential customization options that would make it more valuable for advanced users. While the core technology is impressive, the rigid structure of the platform limits its potential.

Strengths:
- Reliable exercise detection and form monitoring
- Good basic functionality and performance
- Clear equipment guides
- Smooth video streaming

Major Concerns:
- Limited data customization and export options
- Inflexible dashboard and interface layout
- Basic progress tracking without custom metrics
- Insufficient data analysis tools
- No integration with other fitness apps

Suggestions for Improvement:
- Add API access and data export features
- Enable dashboard and metric customization
- Implement more flexible tracking tools
- Support custom measurement types
- Allow workout template creation

The platform works well for basic fitness tracking but needs more customization options to satisfy data-oriented users.
