## Using This Documentation

This documentation is organized to help you understand the system from multiple angles:

1. **System Architecture** - Start here for a high-level understanding of how everything fits together
2. **Project Structure** - Useful for navigating the codebase
3. **Implementation Guides** - Specific guidelines for implementing features
4. **Service Development** - Details on services and their implementation
5. **UI Implementation** - Frontend-specific implementation details
6. **Data Management** - Database and data-related documentation
7. **Roadmaps** - Planning documents for future development

For new developers joining the project, we recommend starting with:
1. [System Architecture](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. [Folder Structure Overview](FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md)
3. [Database Schema](DATABASE_SCHEMA.md)

Then proceed to the specific area you'll be working on.
