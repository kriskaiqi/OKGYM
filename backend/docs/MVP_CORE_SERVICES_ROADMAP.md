# OKGYM MVP Development Roadmap - Accelerated Timeline

This roadmap provides a hyper-optimized plan for implementing the OKGYM Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within an accelerated timeline. This compressed schedule will deliver the core MVP in ~2 weeks, allowing 1 week for implementing high-value post-MVP features.

## Development Approach

This timeline assumes the use of:
- **Component-based architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Reuse of existing entity model relationships** in TypeORM repositories
- **Parallelized development** of backend services
- **Essential documentation** focused on API interfaces
- **Strict feature prioritization** to meet the timeline

## MVP Core Philosophy

The essential MVP will focus on:
1. **Exercise catalog and management**
2. **Workout plan creation and management**
3. **Workout session tracking**
4. **Basic metrics recording and viewing**
5. **Essential user authentication and profiles**

## Timeline Overview

Total Duration: 21 days (3 weeks)

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 (Days 1-7) | Rapid Backend Implementation | All Core Services, API Endpoints, Basic Auth |
| 2 (Days 8-14) | Essential Frontend & Integration | Critical UI Components, Service Integration |
| 3 (Days 15-21) | Post-MVP Enhancements | High-Value Features, Polish, Deployment |

- **Exercise → Equipment**: For equipment-based filtering
- **WorkoutPlan → WorkoutExercise → Exercise**: For structured workout creation
- **WorkoutSession → ExerciseCompletion**: For tracking exercise performance
- **User → WorkoutPlan**: For user-specific workout management
- **User → BodyMetric**: For tracking user measurements

### API Structure
Each service will expose RESTful endpoints following this pattern:

```
/api/v1/exercises              - GET (list), POST (create)
/api/v1/exercises/:id          - GET, PUT, DELETE
/api/v1/workout-plans          - GET (list), POST (create)
/api/v1/workout-plans/:id      - GET, PUT, DELETE
/api/v1/workout-plans/:id/exercises - GET, POST (add exercise)
/api/v1/sessions               - GET (list), POST (create)
/api/v1/sessions/:id           - GET
/api/v1/sessions/:id/exercises - GET, POST (complete exercise)
/api/v1/metrics/body           - GET (list), POST (create)
/api/v1/metrics/performance    - GET (list), POST (create)
/api/v1/auth/register          - POST
/api/v1/auth/login             - POST
/api/v1/users/profile          - GET, PUT
```

### Implementation Priorities

#### Backend Essentials

2. **Transactional operations** for data integrity
3. **Standardized error responses** with meaningful messages
4. **Consistent validation** using class-validator
5. **Proper JWT implementation** with secure token handling

#### Frontend Essentials
1. **Strong typing** for API requests and responses
2. **Consistent form validation** with helpful error messages
3. **Responsive layout** for mobile and desktop usage
4. **Proper loading states** for all async operations
5. **Error handling** with user-friendly messages

## Out of MVP Scope

The following features will NOT be included in the MVP:

1. Advanced analytics and reporting
2. Social features and workout sharing
3. AI-powered exercise analysis
4. Complex goal tracking and progress visualization
5. Advanced filtering and search capabilities
6. External device integrations
7. Email notifications and reminders
8. Performance optimizations (like advanced caching)

These features should be prioritized after successful MVP deployment, based on user feedback and business goals.
