## Implementation Guidelines

### For each service:

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Create service file with proper imports
   - Define interface for service methods
   - Implement constructor with repository access
   - Add cache configuration when applicable

2. **Core Methods Phase**
   - Implement basic CRUD operations first
   - Add proper error handling and validation
   - Add transaction management where needed
   - Implement caching for performance-critical operations

3. **Business Logic Phase**
   - Implement domain-specific logic
   - Add cross-entity operations
   - Implement performance tracking

4. **API Layer Phase**
   - Create controller with endpoints
   - Implement request validation
   - Add response formatting
   - Configure routes

5. **Testing Phase**
   - Create unit tests for each method
   - Implement integration tests for endpoints
   - Test error scenarios
   - Verify business rule enforcement
   - Add performance tests when applicable

## Dependencies Management

- Each service should use the repositories object from src/repositories/index.ts
- Avoid circular dependencies between services
- Use clean patterns for service-to-service communication
- Update service index exports when implementing new services

## Technical Standards

- Use TypeScript interfaces for all method parameters and return types
- Implement consistent error handling using AppError
- Add JSDoc comments for all public methods
- Follow established caching patterns
- Apply performance tracking to critical operations
